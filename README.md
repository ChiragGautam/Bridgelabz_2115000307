           - Using This keyword which refers to the current class instance in Java.
           - Created a specific method displayDetails() to display details.
           
feb 02 - Use static for shared values.
       - Using This keyword which refers to the current class instance in Java.
       - Using final variables for identifiers or constants that should remain unchanged.
       - Using instanceof for safe type-checking and to prevent runtime errors during typecasting.

feb 04 - learned how to visually represent class relationships, including aggregation, composition, and association.
       - understood how to represent objects and their states through object diagrams.
       - learned the difference between aggregation and composition, where aggregation allows independent existence of objects, and composition means objects depend on the parent object.
       - learned how to represent associations between objects, like the relationship between a customer and their account.
       - gained an understanding of UML relationships and how to diagrammatically represent different types of relationships, such as association, aggregation, and composition.

feb 06 - Use Inheritance
       - Use Single Level Inheritance
       - Using Multilevel Inheritance
       - Hierarchical Inheritance
       - Method Overriding
       - Constructor Inheritance in Java
       - Access Modifiers and Inheritance

feb 08 - Encapsulation: Use private fields and public getter/setter methods to protect data, ensuring controlled access and validation. For immutable classes, use final fields and avoid setters.
       - Polymorphism: Program to interfaces, not implementations. This allows handling different object types flexibly, reducing the need for explicit casting and improving maintainability.
       - Interfaces: Define behaviors via interfaces to ensure consistent structure and allow reusability. Use default methods carefully to maintain backward compatibility.
       - Abstract Classes: Provide common functionality for related classes, and force subclasses to implement specific methods. This helps keep inheritance hierarchies clean and flexible.
